# Gender-wise-Market-Base-Analysis
In this Project,  
I developed an Whole Gender-wise Market Base Analysis on distinct Age Group. Steps are explained are as followed:

-> Data Extraction Out of Google Analystics (Looker Studio), Source wise data .i.e.[Google, Facebook, Insta, Tiktok]

-> Data Extraction From SQL Database, (Detailed Data Including: Consignee Name, Purchasing History, Other Biographic Information)

-> Transform Above two Data into Meaningful Format, By using Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib (Python Libraries for Data Analysis | Sciences)

-> Than, Mainly I have to Identify "Gender" From I'd Card Number I get some of those (Odd Assigned to 'Male', Even Assign to 'Female').

-> Afterwards, I used Python Libraries for Gender Identification (gender_detector, gender-guesser), Use Distinct APIs for Gender detection out of Names. And Furthermore Use AI-Based Solution for It.

-> Than, I categorize them against Brands-> Product. And Assosiciate Product They Buyed

-> Adding more to it, do Cohort Analysis, Extract Percentile of Interest of Customers (Who buyed Once (Churn Rate), (Rentenion Rate))

-> Than, Take that Report to Marketing Team they Do Devlop Marketing, On the basis Analysis.
